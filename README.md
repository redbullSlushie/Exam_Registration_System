Exam_Registration_System
This project is to allow pseudo-students to sign up for exams. They can make an account, log in with their credentials and school #. The program allows them to sign up for a maximum of 3 exams. Each exam will have a maximum of 20 students and 1 procotor.
The project will also allow faculty to sign up for an account, create the exams, and see a report of the exams under that faculty's name and the students signed up for said exam.

I used flask and a virtual environment(venv) for this application.
