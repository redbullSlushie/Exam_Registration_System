# Exam_Registration_System
This project is to allow pseudo-students to sign up for exams. They can make an account, log in with their credentials and school #.
The program allows them to sign up for a maximum of 3 exams. Each exam will have a maximum of 20 students and 1 procotor.

I used flask and a virtual environment(venv) for this application.
